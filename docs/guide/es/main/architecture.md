The project for skeleton-docsify it's formed with a base folder and 2 types of documentations docsify/swagger embebed in a only one wrapper to show a good 
presentation of information based in Markdown.

The basic schema in the documentation folder is it:

- docs
  - guide
    - en _// or wherever languange do you want to use_
      - main
        - overview _//initial page_
        - architecture
        - infrastructure
        - links
        - faq
    - es _// another language with the same structure as before_

> NOTE: All before until main folder are markdown files
