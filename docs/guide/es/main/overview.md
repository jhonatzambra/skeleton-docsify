> Documentation for everyone!!!

This repositoty provides a skeleton suggestion, this can be used as a helper to start your own documentation based on [docsify library](https://docsify.js.org/).

Why based on docsify? because this is the default documentation supported by [Fury - Documentation Service](https://furydocs.io/documentation-service/1.0.1/guide/#/README).

In the first overview you should follow the next structure:

- the name of the project
- the technologies using [shield.io](https://img.shields.io) and if it's possible to join the information about coverage
- a brief description about the project, explain main use and general information
- also is important adding a contact for this project. _ownership (email, channel, referrer)_
